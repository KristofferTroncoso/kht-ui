# KHT React UI Test

```npm install kht-ui```

## Notes:
* Double type checking with Typescript interfaces and prop-types
* JSDoc documentation for easy consumption during development
* Tested with Jest
* styled with styled-components for conflict-free css
* only functional components with new hooks feature, no classes
